# Steelseries-OLED-Dvd-Screensaver

This has only been tested on a Apex 5 and it will need some tinkering to work. You should be able to change the `logo.png` but ive not tested that.
Based on edbgon oled [code](https://github.com/edbgon/steelseries-oled)

Run `main.py` to see what PID you should enter into `supported_pid`. If needed change the screen resolution in `resolution`.
